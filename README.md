# Global-Terrorism-EDA
In this EDA project, I analyzed The Global Terrorisum Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017.The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have ocuurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks.  The purpose of this summary is to provide an overview of my findings and insights.The dataset consisted of more than 180,000 rows and 135 columns. I encountered many challenges during the analysis. One of the challenges is to identify which columns are necessary to analysis bacause most them are unnecessary.we didn’t get any thing from it that’s why i selected 19 columns to analysis.To analyze the data, I used so many python libraries such as Numpy,pandas,matpotlib and seaborThrough my analysis, I observed The Terrorist activities  are surged in each years .They used Bombing and explosive method is to attacks            
# Libraries Used
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
# Project Objective?
* How many Number of Terrorist Activities in Each year
* How many Number of attack were there in 1970 & 2017 and also find percentage of the attacks had increased or decreased
* How many number of casualities corresponding to killed people in each country for each year
* What kind of Methods terrorist are used to attacks
* How many Terrorist Attacks over Regions from 1920-2017
* How many Total Terrorist Attacks in each Region from 1970 to 2017
* What are the Total Casualties (Killed +wounded) in each Region
* What are the Top 10 countries were attacked
* What are the Total Casualities(Killed +Wounded)in each Country
* What type of Targets are terrorist manily focused
* How many Total number of terrorist attack in each country and regions
* How many  total number of attacks in each country using Globe
* Which Country suffered the maximum attacks and minimum attacks
* Which terrorist organizations have carried out their operations in each country..

# Data Cleaning & Manipulations
## Handling Null Values
* Handled and removed the Null values with statistical mode methods
* Using heatmap to identify the How many Null values
* checked the unqine values
* Adding Killed,Wounded columns to get Casualties column
# Data Visualization
Data visualization is the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make it easier to understand and gain insights from them. The graphs used here for study are: -
* Barplot
* Scatter Plot
* Heatmap
* Countplot
* gloab
* areaplot
* geoplot
